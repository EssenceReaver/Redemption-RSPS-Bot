# Script Info
This gives you information about every script I have available. I didnt mention it, but a lot of these scripts rely on have an advanced bandage to prevent death. Some use potions if available in inventory (extreme power pot, 3x slayer pts potion)

If a script requires an attack style change, then you will need to have the same weapon that is hardcoded into the script within your inventory. You also need to have the inventory interface open to be able to do weapon swaps.
